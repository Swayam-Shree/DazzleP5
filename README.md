# Dazzle
stylish 3D multiplayer game on the web to hang out, draw around, watch videos together and much more. There are no goals, you have no enemies, just continue with the shitposting. Hopefully the first thing you draw is not a dick.

Game is only for pc browsers.

If cursor is visible and camera is not moving, click near center of screen to request pointer lock. Press esc to exit pointer lock to interact with the ui.

If you experience regullar disconnections and issues with paint not saving on the server, it is due to the free render server. Heroku servers were great, but they closed their free tier last year(2022).

Some videos might be unavailable on the shared youtube player due to age restrictions.

Experimental Feature: Gravity Manipulation: in the browser console, enter "enableGravityManipulation=true", then press middle mouse button on any plane to make that plane axis as your floor.
